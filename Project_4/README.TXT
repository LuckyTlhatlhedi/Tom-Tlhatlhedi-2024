This Java program provides several utility methods to perform common operations on integers:
1. **Reverse Digits**: Reverses the digits of a given number.
2. **Sum of Digits**: Calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
3. **Increment Digits**: Increments each digit of the number by 1 and wraps around from 9 to 0.

The program consists of two main classes:
- **`Number`**: Contains the utility methods to manipulate numbers.
- **`Main`**: The class with the `main()` method that demonstrates the use of the `Number` class.

## Features
- **Reverse Digits**: Reverses the order of digits in a number.
- **Sum Digits**: Calculates and returns the sum of the digits.
- **Increment Digits**: Increments each digit in the number, handling digit wrap-around (e.g., 9 becomes 0).
